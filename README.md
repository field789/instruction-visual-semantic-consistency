# instruction-visual-semantic-consistency
An instructionâ€“visual semantic consistency framework that explicitly aligns instructions with visual observations by identifying and preserving landmark regions before visual compression.
This project uploads files by improving [NaVid-VLN-CE](https://github.com/jzhzhang/NaVid-VLN-CE), introducing the instruction-visual-semantic-consistency framework, which further enhances its original level.
In the repository, the train file is the training code, landmark_head is the functional code, and the arch file is the modification of NaVid-VLN-CE, which includes the interface of landmark_head.py.
